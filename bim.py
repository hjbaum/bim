# Algorithm:
# 1. Solve linear inverse problem using Born

# 2. Solve scattering problem at object and observation points

# 3. a) Substitute field in 2 into integrand in integral eq and 
#    b) Solve inverse problem to recover next order distribution ftn

# 4. Repeat 2 and compare fields with measured data. If difference < 5% 
#    of scattered field, terminate successfully. Otherwise repeat until soln converges
